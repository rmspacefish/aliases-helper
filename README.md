# Command Line Configurator Utility

Python script to set up the command line environment in a new Unix environment or for MinGW and 
git on Windows.

# Windows

On Windows, a `.bash_aliases` file will be created both for `MinGW64` and `git`.
Currently, the user needs to take care of enabling use of the `bash_aliases` file in the 
`.bashrc` file of MinGW64 by uncommenting the respective lines.

# Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get install git vim-gtk3
```
